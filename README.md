# Nigeria-PMS-Fuel-Price-Per-Liter
# I conducted an analysis on the average fuel price per liter (PMS) in Nigeria from January 1985 to July 2023 using Power BI. During this period, average fuel price per liter went from 20 Kobo to â‚¦680 within 38years. Also, analyzed domestic oil production and crude oil exported in Nigeria from January 2020 to June 2023.

The findings indicate that between January 1985 and July 2023, the average fuel price per liter increased by a staggering 339,900%. This indicates a massive surge in the cost of fuel over a period of nearly 38 years. The increase in fuel price paints a clear picture of the substantial and sudden rise in fuel prices in Nigeria. It highlights the severity of the fuel price inflation, which have led to the significant implications for the economy, businesses, and citizens, impacting transportation costs, goods and services prices, and overall cost of living. This dramatic increase in fuel prices has led to economic challenges and hardships for the population, and it calls for effective measures to manage the situation and find sustainable solutions to address the issue.
During January 2020 to June 2023, there was a sharp decline in Crude Oil Export, amounting to a decrease of 50.62%. This indicates that the volume of crude oil exported from Nigeria significantly reduced over the span of three and a half years. Similarly, Domestic Production of crude oil in Nigeria also trended down during the same period, with a decrease of 39.61%. This means that the amount of crude oil produced within Nigeria decreased significantly over the specified timeframe.
The rapid and substantial increase in the average fuel price per liter in Nigeria poses significant challenges to the economy and citizens' well-being.

# Recommendations
To address this situation and mitigate its impact, the Nigerian government should consider implementing a gradual and transparent reform of fuel subsidies, individuals should invest in renewable energy. Government should promote fuel-efficient technologies and practices across various sectors, including transportation and industries. This can help reduce the overall demand for fuel and ease the burden on citizens.
Nigerian government should encourage local refining, government should support the low-middle Income citizen. Long-Term energy planning policies should be adopted.
By implementing these recommendations, Nigeria can better manage the challenges posed by the significant increase in fuel prices, promote energy sustainability, and alleviate the burden on citizens and businesses. It's crucial to take a holistic approach that addresses both short-term relief and long-term energy security and sustainability goals.
